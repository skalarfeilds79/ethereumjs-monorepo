## 0.4.0 - 2022-03-11

### Merge Kiln v2 Testnet Support

This release fully supports the Merge [Kiln](https://kiln.themerge.dev/) testnet `v2` complying to the latest Merge [specs](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/kiln-spec). You can use this release to sync with the testnet, combining with a suited consensus client (e.g. the Lodestar client). See [Kiln](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client/kiln) instructions to get things going! üöÄ

### Bug Fixes

- Geth genesis files: Minor `baseFeePerGas` related fix and other improvements, PRs [#1720](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1720) and [#1741](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1741)

## 0.3.0 - 2022-02-01

### New RPC Endpoints: eth_getLogs, eth_getTransactionReceipt and eth_getTransactionByHash

This release adds receipt and log saving functionality to the client. There has been a new database infrastructure laid out in PR [#1556](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1556) for data, caching and indexes.

A new `ReceiptsManager` handles receipt and log saving and lookup, along with the `txHash -> [blockHash, txIndex]` index that is limited by `--txLookupLimit` (default = 2350000 blocks = about one year, 0 = entire chain).

Enable with `--saveReceipts` and use with --rpc to enable `eth_getLogs`, `eth_getTransactionReceipt` and `eth_getTransactionByHash` endpoints.

### Sepolia PoW Testnet Support

The client now supports the new [Sepolia](https://sepolia.ethdevops.io/) testnet, which is a PoW network intended to replace the `ropsten` network, see PR [#1581](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1581).

A client connecting to the Sepolia network can be started as follows:

```shell
ethereumjs --network=sepolia
```

### Allow past block numbers in RPC queries

The RPC calls `call`, `getBalance`, `getCode`, `getStorageAt`, `getTransactionCount`, and `estimateGas` up till now only supported being called with the `latest` tag. This has been updated in PR [#1598](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1598) and it is now possible to use past block numbers for the various calls.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed browser build and libp2p sync, PR [#1588](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1588)
- Fixed error logging stack trace output, PR [#1595](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1595)
- Fixed broken dependency in webpack where node's constants package isn't being polyfilled by webpack 5, PR [#1621](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1621)
- Fixed `mainnet` consensus bug from block `4,993,075` (`byzantium`) where a tx goes OOG but refunds get applied anyways (thanks @LogvinovLeon for reporting! ‚ù§Ô∏è), PR [#1603](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1603)

## 0.2.0 - 2021-11-09

### Experimental Merge Support

This client release comes with experimental Merge support as specified in `EIP-3675` commit [504954e3](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/504954e3bba2b58712d84865966ebc17bd4875f5/EIPS/eip-3675.md) and the Engine API [v1.0.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/v1.0.0-alpha.2/src/engine/interop/specification.md). This is the spec snapshot used for the [Merge Interop event](https://hackmd.io/@n0ble/merge-interop-spec) in Greece which happened in October 2021.

For the courageous there are instructions [here](https://hackmd.io/B1nMKhIiRBWRtgP4-d5KHw) on how to connect the EthereumJS client with a Lodestar Eth 2.0 client and produce blocks together. Note that specifications are changing quickly though and a new testnet is already planned, so this is not guaranteed to work.

Merge related work has been done in the following PRs (all pretty extensive):

- PR [#1509](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1509) (first Engine API steps, JSON RPC block parameter alignments, HF-by-TD fixes)
- PR [#1512](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1512) (continued Engine API, `--rpcEngine` CLI option, Taunas testnet, temporary eth_getLogs RPC mockup)
- PR [#1530](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1530) (dedicated Engine API port, Pithos testnet, Docker)

### An Update on Mainnet

The 1,230,833 block consensus bug we had in the `v0.1.0` release has been fixed in the VM dependency (see PR [#1516](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1516) and PR [#1524](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1524)), so sync on `mainnet` will now continue from this block onwards.

The "Mainnet sync" adventure now comes to a halt though around the Shanghai dDoS attacks mainnet blocks ranging from 2,286,910 to 2,717,576 where we realize that our VM is just not optimized enough to hold through these various edge case scenarios.

We'll take this occasion and do some sustainable performance work on the VM, where everyday developer use cases will likely also benefit. This will realistically take some months time though. See Issue [#1536](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/issues/1536) and related issues if you are interested or want to join the effort.

## 0.1.0 - 2021-09-29

Heydiho, glad you are here! üòÄ

After over a year of continued development the EthereumJS team is proud to announce that
our client is finally stable, feature-complete (or - let's call it: feature-consistent)
and useful in many regards that we have decided to do a first official release! üåº

There has been such an extensive amount of work done that it
would be neither useful nor enlightening to list all associated PRs.

So here are just a few milestones, where the ones before November 2020 happened in
the - now archived - standalone `ethereumjs-client` monorepo before we moved the client
to our monorepo
[ethereumjs-monorepo](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client):

- Full transition to `TypeScript`, PR [#144](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client/pull/144) and subsequent PRs
- Integration with our monorepo CI config, e.g. PR [#153](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client/pull/153)
- Full alignment with the latest versions of the `EthereumJS` monorepo libraries (`Block`, `Tx`, `VM`,...), e.g. PR [#158](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client/pull/158)
- Integration of the `@ethereumjs/vm` to execute on blocks, PR [#1028](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1028)
- EIP-1459: DNS peer recovery, PR [#1070](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1070)
- Following the VM integration: working down various HF bugs like this one from TangerineWhistle (hardening our VM along the way): PR [#1101](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1101)
- Tip-of-the-chain syncing behavior, PR [#1132](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1132)
- A basic transaction pool, PR [#1176](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1176)
- Upgraded `devp2p` `ETH` protocol up to version `ETH/66`, PR [#1331](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1331)
- `LES` protocol v3 and v5 support, PR [#1324](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1324)
- Support for `devp2p` snappy compression (RLPx v5), PR [#1399](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1399)
- A simple miner for PoA/clique, PR [#1444](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1444)
- Finalized on `devp2p` message handling support (e.g. by adding `NEW_BLOCK` rebroadcast capabilities) to serve as a good network citizen, PR [#1458](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1458)
- Added developer capabilities, e.g. by adding a `--dev` flag to auto-start and prefund a miner, PR [#1492](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/pull/1492)

And here we are. üôÇ

We joined various ephemeral testnets along the way - like `Yolov3` (still remember? üòÉ) and `Calaveras` - and helped find consensus bugs before they reached `mainnet` in preparation for the latest forks like `london` in conjunction with the other clients.

Now we are ready for the next step and hand this out to you - the community! ü•≥

We are eager to see what you will do with this client and how you will use this software, which for the first time in Ethereum's history brings the full Ethereum core protocol stack - complemented by the excellent [Lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafe/lodestar) client ChainSafe is developing on the Eth2 side - into the hands of Node.js developers.

We have also updated our [README](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-monorepo/tree/master/packages/client/README.md) on the client directly before the release which you should take as a concise reference on the currently implemented client capabilities, some usage instructions complemented by various examples, and developer notes.

**So thanks to the whole EthereumJS team - including some former team members - for the relentless work on this, and some special thanks to Vinay Pulim, who wrote the initial version of this software and therefore provided the ground for all this subsequent work!**

Again: Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è Exciting times ahead.

## [0.0.6] - 2020-06-19

### Revival Release üåª

After a longer period of stalled development this release brings the `EthereumJS` client back
to life respectively a usable state by doing necessary dependency updates and modernizing CI.
It also comes with an updated documentation and user-facing improvements like a more reliable
and better communicated sync mechanism.

Most notable for development is the upgrade of the `ethereumjs-devp2p` dependency to `v3.0.1`.
The devp2p library is now `TypeScript` based and comes with an improved debugging experience
which will be helpful when working on further improving the sync reliability of the client and
hunting for networking bugs.

To ease jumping into the code base there is now a new structure
[diagram](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-client/blob/master/diagram/client.svg)
showing the relations between the main components as well as the initialization and message flow.
